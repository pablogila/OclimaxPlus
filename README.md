# OclimaxPlus
OclimaxPlus is a Python program to automatize batch calculations of neutron scattering _S(Q,E)_ simulations via the [OCLIMAX software](https://sites.google.com/site/ornliceman/download).  

## Usage

Run in **Windows Powershell**:  
`python OclimaxPlus.py`

The first time you run the program, it will create an empty batch job file, called **OclimaxPlus_JOBS.txt**. In this file, you will introduce the batch jobs to perform, and then run the program again.
